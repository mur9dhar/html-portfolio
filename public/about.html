<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my Career as a School Teacher for Maths Subject in Springdales Public School, Gajuwaka, visakhapatnam for sometime. it was fun teaching students from classes year 6 to year 10. 
  after my short stinct as Teacher, i pursued my learning further in computers by doing is diploma certification from APTECH. After successful completion, I started working as faculty in APTECH, in Rajam.
  after working for 2 years as Faculty. I pursed my studies in computer science by doing Master of Computer Applications. once my post graduation completed, I resumed my teaching career as Lecturer in Computer science
  and worked for 2 years.</p>


<p>While being a Maths Teacher, Computer Faculty and Lecuturer, it gave me an opportunity to teach and train kids from as small as 6 year old to 20 Year olds.
  it's great experience. However, looking at pay limitations and career growth, I chose to work as a Customer Service Executive in HSBC, Vizag. 
  This is my first step towards my IT Career. Initally worked as Process Executive, handling credit decision managment and credi management system. Here, I was offered an opportunity to be a Software Tester, testing the functionality of
  Business Applicaitons related to retail and commercial. This paved a patch towards IT and I scaled up as Test Lead. 
</p>

<p>My role being a Test Lead opened doors to the outside opportunities and I was invited to attend an interview for Scope International, Malaysia which part of Standard Chartered Bank. I am thankful for this opportuinty to my Brother and Candy - the Manage who noticed the opetntial and offered a job as Senior Test Analyst.
  in scope international moved up in the ladder from Senior Test Analyst to Test Manage and then as Test Coordination for one thier large Core Banking Project - SIMCO i.e SIngapore Malaysia CoreBanking System
